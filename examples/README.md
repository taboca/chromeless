This directory contains several different examples which demonstrate different
aspects of writing the HTML to build your own browser.  In order of increasing
complexity:

[first_browser](first_browser/) shows you the very basics of building a browser.
This example looks very much like a normal webpage and inline we document where
chromeless' features come into play.  Start with this example.

[thumbnails](thumbnails/) A more fancy example that shows you how to build a 
basic tabbed browser.  The tabs are webpage snapshots taken using canvas.

[webgl](webgl/) The fanciest sample here!  Demonstrates how webgl can be used
in chromeless for fancy visual effects.
