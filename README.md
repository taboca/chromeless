## Welcome To Chromeless!

The 'chromeless' project is an experiment into making it possible to build
a web browser using only web technologies, like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

The project is based on [addon-sdk (aka,
"jetpack")](http://github.com/mozilla/addon-sdk), and
[xulrunner](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/xulrunner).

## Current State

This project is *highly* experimental, rapidly changing, and probably
insecure.  As the project matures, this notice will change.

## Design Overview

The main goal of chromeless is to explore authoring a browser interface
in HTML.  The chromeless "platform" provides tools to run a browser that looks
like a native application, but where all of the look and feel, and many of the
behaviors are defined by HTML, CSS, and javascript provided by the developer.

This "browser HTML" is basically a normal webpage, but with several important differences:

  * The HTML file has access to a 'window.require()' function that it can use to
    access new APIs that give it increased priviledges.

  * (untrusted) Web content can be rendered inside iframes which are children of the
    top level "browser HTML".  This content cannot tell its rendered inside an iframe,
    and has no special access.

  * Several new events and conventions are introduced.  For instance, the title of the
    top level browser HTML is the name of the running process (not yet implemented),
    new, non-standard events are available to the top level browser HTML which give it
    a priviledged view (and control) over embedded web content.

## Prerequisites

* OSX 10.5 and later, Windows XP and later, or probably a modern versions of linux (32 or 64 bit).
* Python 2.5 - 2.7 (3 is not supported); Python 2.6 or 2.7 are recommended (testing isn't as thorough with 2.5).

## Getting Started

The top level `chromeless` python script is capable of several things:

  * running a browser when provided a path to 'browser HTML'
  * packaging a browser as a xulrunner package, or a standalone exectuable (not yet implemented)
  * running unit tests (not yet implemented)
  * generating static documentation for all current APIs (not yet implemented)

To get started, you should clone this repository (or download a versioned snapshot) and run:

    (win32) C:\xxx\chromeless> chromeless
    (osx)   $ ./chromeless

By default, the HTML files in `examples/first_browser` will be executed, and you'll see a very
simple browser based on them.  You may also specify an alternate browser HTML on the command line:

    (win32) C:\xxx\chromeless> chromeless examples\webgl
    (osx)   $ ./chromeless examples/webgl

From here, you can inspect the implementation of any of these samples, copy, modify and explore.

Finally, it's possible to generate a ZIP package of your HTML browser which is an installable
XULRunner application (danger, experimental):

    (win32) C:\xxx\chromeless> chromeless examples\webgl package
    (osx)   $ ./chromeless examples/webgl package

This will output a zip file which you can install using the --install-app flag to xulrunner.

## More Information

Further documentation can be found inline in examples at the moment. In the near future there
will be a tutorial and API documentation.
